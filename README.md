# Shipping Operations Power BI Dashboard

Welcome to my Power BI dashboard analysing shipping operations data! This project visualises key metrics from shipping, documentation, and warehouse data, providing insights into shipment statuses, clearance times, documentation errors, and warehouse efficiency.

## Dashboard Overview
This dashboard includes:
- **Shipment Status Distribution**: A pie chart showing the proportion of Cleared, Delayed, and Pending shipments.
- **Average Clearance Time by Destination**: A bar chart comparing clearance times across Rotterdam, Antwerp, and Hamburg.
- **Documentation Errors by Processor**: A table summarising errors by staff (Aisha, Linda, John, Michael).
- **Warehouse Processing Efficiency**: A line chart tracking goods processed and processing time by region (Accra, Takoradi, Tema).
- **Item Count by Origin**: A column chart showing shipment volumes from Takoradi, Lagos Port, and Tema Port.

## Files
- **Shipping_Operations_Dashboard.pbix**: The Power BI file for interactive exploration (requires Power BI Desktop).
- **Shipping_Operations_Dashboard.pdf**: A static PDF version for quick viewing.


## How to View
1. Download `Shipping_Operations_Dashboard.pbix` and open it in [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) for an interactive experience.
2. View `Shipping_Operations_Dashboard.pdf` for a static overview.


## Insights
- Lagos Port has the highest average clearance time (12.6 hours), indicating potential bottlenecks.
- Takoradi handles the most shipments but has a high delay rate (40%).
- John processes the most documents but has a higher error rate (avg 0.5 errors/doc).

## Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop**: For creating the dashboard.
- **Data Source**: `shipping_operations_data.xlsx` (shipments, documentation, warehouse data).
